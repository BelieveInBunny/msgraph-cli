# TODO: Consider handling with a user friendly message to indicate that either: 1) the scope is not applicable to delegate auth, 
# 2) they may need to acquire admin consent to use the scope. This brings up another set of questions around how is the app
# registered and what is the auth story.

# Note: the CLI is unverified - we need to have a path to making it verified. This is noted in the consent screen. 
# I also had to consent using an admin. We need to nail the story around how regular users can use the CLI.

# 5. Logout

.\mg logout

Logged out successfully

# Note: What are we actually doing? Just deleting the access token? Is there a refresh token?

.\mg logout

# Running logout again gives us this message. Nit: You already logged out.
